# Usage Patterns

Calibrie offers flexibility in how you define and execute analysis pipelines.

*   **[Python API](python_api.md):** Define pipelines programmatically within Python scripts for maximum control and integration with other Python code.
*   **[YAML Configuration](yaml_config.md):** Define pipelines using declarative YAML files, promoting reproducibility, sharing, and modification without changing Python code. This often leverages the `dracon` library for advanced features.
*   **[Command Line Tools](command_line.md):** Run pre-defined or custom YAML pipelines easily using the provided command-line scripts (`calibrie-run`, `calibrie-gating`).
