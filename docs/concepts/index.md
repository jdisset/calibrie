# Core Concepts

Understanding the underlying principles and components of Calibrie helps in building effective and interpretable pipelines.

*   **[Architecture](architecture.md):** How Pipelines, Tasks, and the Context object work together.
*   **[Linear Compensation](compensation.md):** The theory and practice of correcting spectral overlap.
*   **[Protein Mapping](mapping.md):** Standardizing signals from different fluorescent proteins relative to a reference.
*   **[MEF Calibration](calibration.md):** Converting relative units to absolute Molecules of Equivalent Fluorophore using bead standards.
*   **[Colinearization (Advanced)](colinearization.md):** Addressing non-linear channel responses before linear unmixing.
